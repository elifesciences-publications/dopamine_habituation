# dopamine_habituation

This project focuses on a gene that modulates dopamine signaling and consequently affects tap habituation. 
Tap habituation in many gene mutant combinations has been assessed, and this repository will be used to compile
data to generate summary figures and statistics.


## Figures it generates
* Reversal probability vs time

## Statistics reported

## How to use it

### Installation Dependencies

`Java`, `R`, R packages `ggplot2`, `plyr`, `stringr`, `gridExtra`, `asbio`,and `fmsb`, and the Multi-worm Tracker 
Analysis software (`Chore.jar`) as a shell script in the executable path named `Chore`. 
To "easily" do this on a Mac or Linux OS, please follow the following installation 
instructions:


### Running the analysis

* Set working directory to project's root directory

* Call `habituation_probability_driver_CL.sh` from the `Bash Shell`


#### This code is still a work in progress. More instructions to come as code is developed further.
